{"name":"Notes","tagline":"Notes procedurally generates melodies and beats","body":"### What does it do?\r\nNotes procedurally generates MIDI files for use as Chord Progressions, Melodies and Beats with a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). All DAWs are capable of MIDI playback, however, Notes was tested using Ableton Live. The procedural generation process used in Notes is explained well in [this short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z8CuAC_-bg) and similar tools are available in [Java](https://github.com/igorski/molecular-music-generator), [Unity](http://www.tomsnively.com/games/MolecularMusicBox.html) and as a [Native Instruments plugin](http://www.native-instruments.com/en/community/reaktor-user-library/entry/show/7997/). Notes operates in terminal and generates a midi file based on the inputted rules. Notes generates Melodies in either 'major' or 'minor' modes in addition to a Beat generating 'drums' mode.\r\n\r\n###Demonstration Tracks\r\n[A playlist of notes.py generated music is maintained here.](https://soundcloud.com/b38tn1k/sets/math-dance-music)\r\n\r\n### How do I install it?\r\n1. Ensure you have Python installed by typing `python -v` into the terminal.     \r\n2. <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesrobertcarthew/notes/archive/master.zip\"> Download Notes. </a>     \r\n3. Navigate to the Notes directory in terminal: *cd <path to file>*. If you have no experience with using terminal have a <a href=\"http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/introduction-to-the-mac-os-x-command-line\">read through this.</a>    \r\n4. Notes requires <a href=\"http://www.numpy.org/\"> numpy</a> and <a href=\"https://code.google.com/p/midiutil/\"> midiutil</a>. To install these dependancies you can try running `pip install -r requirements.txt` or follow the links for alternate methods.    \r\n5. You may have to type `chmod a+x notes.py` to make notes.py executable.    \r\n6. To check if all is well type `python notes.py 3 4 -i 5`. If the installation is successful you should receive the message `I made you Int3and4Ite5_in_1_minor.mid`.    \r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\nI aim Notes at a bin within an Ableton project and generate a stack of MIDI files that I then pull into the Ableton session and apply to a synth or drum. Inside Ableton I will double/ half the tempo of the midi files and apply to either monophonic or polyphonic devices to create pads, basslines and beats. \r\n\r\nThe minimum required input for Notes is:   \r\n`python notes.py 3 4 -i 5 `    \r\nwhere `3 4` determine two time intervals and `-i 5` determines the number of iterations of the procedural generation algorithm to be applied.    \r\nFor a complete list of options available:    \r\n`python notes.py -h`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
